# TVM Models Optimization Research: Boosting Performance

This repository is dedicated to the research and optimization of machine learning models using Apache TVM. Our focus is on enhancing model performance through TVM's optimization techniques. We explore various models across different domains, fine-tuning parameters, and leveraging TVM's capabilities to boost efficiency.

In this work, models such as ResNet50, MNIST, CTRL, BVLC AlexNet ONNX, and prequantized MobileNet were considered.
